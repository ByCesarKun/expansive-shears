The mod includes shears made from all the following materials:

- Wooden Shears (crafted with sticks)
- Stone Shears (crafted with cobblestone)
- Golden Shears (crafted with gold ingots)
- Diamond Shears (crafted with diamonds)
- Netherite Shears (crafted with netherite ingots)
- Amethyst Shears (crafted with amethyst shards)
- Emerald Shears (crafted with emeralds)
- Lapis Lazuli Shears (crafted with lapis lazuli)
- Copper Shears (crafted with copper ingots)
